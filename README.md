# Summary

This is the project for FUTURE CAMP NLP WEEK2. With a Keras implementation of DSSM/CDSSM, the model determines whether two given sentences are related to each other.

# Structure

* conf.py: configuration for parameters and directory names.
* data_provider.py: data providing functions.
* model_structure: the nn structure for DSSM/CDSSM/CGRU.
* train.py: training model.
* eval.py: evaluating model.

# How to run the code

1. Set relevant parameters according to your choice in conf.py.
2. Run train.py.
3. Run eval.py.
* You need to put data files under directory camp_dataset2/ prior to running the code. The author is not authorized to publish the proprietory data, so you may have to obtain data yourself.
